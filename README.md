# CMPG-323-Overview---31607500

# Repository and Projects

Project 1 - Creating a github page for the CMPG overview using a kanban project to plan for the semester. This is the start as well as the basis of all future projects. The kanban board contains multiple views that are board views or table views making the board easier to understand and decipher.
Here are the links for both the repository and project:

		https://github.com/LoftieFourie/CMPG-323-Overview---31607500.git
		https://github.com/users/LoftieFourie/projects/1
		
Project 2 - After the API development training we will create a github repository to display all work that has been done for the project. 

Project 3 - An existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application will be given to the learners to be enhanced and improved. This is to test the ability to read and understand code. A github repository will be created to store all changes made to the application as well as the finnished product.

project 4 - The learner will use the web application used is project 3 and test it using a test dataset with input data and a desired output. This prosess should be automated using RPA. All progress made as well as the finished program will be stored in a github repository.

project 5 - A report will be built in Power Bi containing all relevant data the devices gathered. the data will be shared through visualisations built into a report or dashboard. The report as well as all related programs will be stored in a github repository.


# Projects Repositories

Project 1 - The Repository contains a readme file with information on project 1 as well as information on the other projects, more information will be added as the projects progress.

# Branching Strategy

Branching strategies will depend on the project as well as the challenges it presents here follows each repositories branching strategies and will be updated when neccesary:

Project 1 - No branches currently needed aside from the main branch as there is only one version of the kanban board while the readme will be updated as the POE and other projects progress.

project 2 - API Development had two brances to ensure the main branch is always in working codition and using the development branch to make changes.

project 3 - Used only the main branch for the development in project 3 as that is al I felt was neccesary, it would have been more productive to use multiple branches in this case.

project 4 - Using UI path for automation I made use of only one branch as all the edits were saved in UiPatch itself thus any changes made were first made in ui path and uploaded when it is confirmewd to be working.

project 5 - Using Power Bi Iused the same strategy as with project 4 in the sense that all changes made were saved on power Bi as well as published to power Bi, after everything was in working order the final project was submitted to github.

# .gitignore in each project

project 1 - No .gitignore will be used as the only file to commit is the ReadMe file which is crucial to the assignment.

project 2 - Git ignore to ignore any files that may give away any personal as well as confidential information.

project 3 - Git ignore to ignore any files that may give away any personal as well as confidential information.

project 4 - No git ignore needed for UiPath and the way it was used for the project.

project 5 - No git ignore needed for PowerBi and the report made using powerBi.
